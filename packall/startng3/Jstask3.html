    <h2>HNG JS Task 3 </h2>
    Task:

Write a function that takes one parameter (a whole number/integer) and checks if numbers from 1 to the given parameter (inclusive) are divisible by 2,3,5 while replacing with the appropriate words as specified below. <br>

* Numbers divisible by 2 are replaced by "yu" <br>

* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by "gi"  <br>

* Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by "oh" <br>

* Numbers are unchanged if not divsible by any of the above  <br>



If a number is divisible by more than one of the above, replace and join the words representing their divsiors, separating by hyphen (-).  <br>

NB: "divisible" in this case means no remainder after division.  <br>



Return an array containing all numbers from 1 to the passed argument(inclusive) where all divisible numbers have been replaced as specified above.  <br>



Call the function and pass 100 as an argument.  <br>

Call the function and pass it a random number of your choice  <br>



Examples:  <br>

4 is only divisible by 2. It would be replaced by "yu"  <br>

6 is divisible by 2 and 3. It would be replaced by "yu-gi"  <br>

30 is divisible by 2,3,and 5, so it would be replaced by "yu-gi-oh"  <br>

49 is not divisible by 2,3 or 5  <br>



Example output:  <br>

Assuming the function is called with 10 as argument, the output array would be of the form:  <br>

[1,"yu","gi",4,"oh","yu-gi",7,"yu","gi","yu-oh"  <br>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      function hng(num){
        var num = document.getElementById('num');
        for (var i = 1; i <= num.value; i++) {
          if (i % 2 == 0) {
            if (i % 2 == 0 && i % 3 == 0) {
              document.write('"yu-gi" <br>')
              continue
            } else if (i % 2 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
              document.write('"yu-oh" <br>')
              continue
            }
            else {
              document.write('"yu" <br>')
              continue
            }
          }
           if(i % 3 == 0) {
            document.write('"gi" <br>')
            continue
          }

         if(i % 5 == 0) {
            document.write('"oh" <br>')
            continue
          }

          document.write(i + '<br> ' )
        }

      }
